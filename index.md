## About

I am a PhD candidate at Brown University at the Center for Computational Molecular Biology advised by [Dr. David Rand](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/drand). Working with a _Drosophila_ model system, I study the role of mitochondiral genetic variation and its interactions with nuclear genomes and/or the environment in quantitiative traits and adaptive evolution.
