# About

I am a PhD candidate at Brown University at the Center for Computational Molecular Biology, advised by [Dr. David Rand](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/drand). Working with a _Drosophila_ model system, I study the role of mitochondrial genetic variation and its interactions with nuclear genomes and/or the environment in quantitative traits and adaptive evolution. 

Before starting my PhD, I earned a BS in Computer Science and a BS in Applied Mathematics, with a minor in Biological Sciences, from Arizona State University. There, I worked primarily with systems of ordinary differential equations to model biological processes, such as the infection dynamics of misfolded prion proteins or the Dengue virus in novel populations. 

I have interned at Los Alamos National Lab with [Dr. Chris Neale](https://cnls.lanl.gov/external/people/Chris_Neale.php) at the Center for Nonlinear Studies, where I developed a testing framework for classical molecular dynamics simulations coupled with Monte Carlo moves. I also worked as a research assistant for [Dr. Violet Syrotiuk](https://search.asu.edu/profile/518662) developing algorithms for large-scale interaction screening in network testbeds.

## Current Projects

### Mitonuclear genetic and environmental interaction effects for complex traits*
*Now in review at Nature Communications and available on bioRxiv ([Genetic and environmental interactions outweigh mitonuclear coevolution for complex traits in Drosophila](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.24.689096))!

I use a mitonuclear genetic model that places forgein mitochondrial genotypes onto common nuclear backgrounds to create genetic mismatches of varying degree. By sampling mtDNA variation from two natural populations in Zimbabwe and Beijing and two related species, I quantify the relative contribution of mitonuclear interactions to four complex traits. Additionally, I use an environmental stressor, rotenone, to uncover how genotype-environment interactions further influence these traits. 

### Experimenal evolution of mitonuclear genotypes*

*Presented at SMBE2024 and DROS2025 (view slides [here](/assets/darwin_SMBE24/index.html) and [here](/assets/darwin_DROS25/index.html))

In this project, I have actively maintained 24 replicate populations of _Drosophila_ for over 4 years (80+ generations). The populations have both mitochondrial and nuclear genetic variation. The primary aim of this project is to quantify the molecular adaptive response to a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, rotenone. Using this system, I can identify parallel and idiosyncratic responses to selection across both genomes and characterize how predictable directed selection on a protein-protein interaction network (OXPHOS) is.
